C1: H Score Compression,11a: Compression quantification + sensitivity,"BERT CV=4.0% vs literature 20% (compression factor 5.0x). At CV=20%, H contributes 8.5% of Var(log DEI), rank ρ=0.950",Low — E dominance robust even under decompression,—
C2: Yelp Proxy Bias,11b: Two-stage residualization,"Controls R²=0.077, DEI rank ρ=0.9986, tier agreement=94.9%, mean |rank shift|=1.6",Low — rankings essentially unchanged after controls,"H_controlled, log_DEI_ctrl"
C3: Missing Nutritional Dimension,11c: NDI (NRF-7) + DEI-N + 3D Pareto,"DEI vs DEI-N rank ρ=0.931, 3D Pareto frontier: 18 dishes (vs 11 original), NDI range [1.0, 22.3]",Medium — nutritionally dense meats gain ranks; Pareto set more balanced,"NDI, log_NDI, log_DEI_N, meal_role, protein_g, etc."
C4: Functional Category Inequivalence,11d: Recipe-based classification + nutrition-constrained substitution,"13 functional categories, within-category H contribution avg 1.0% (vs 0.3% global), 1,980 nutrition-constrained substitutions",Medium — within-category results confirm global pattern,category_recipe
C5: Refinement Cost Curve (New Concept),11e: Dish family analysis + hedonic elasticity,"15 dish families, global mean α=-0.055 (spending more E yields negligible H gain), most families: first 50% of E captures 80%+ of H range",High — new contribution: 'refinement tax' concept,"family, refinement_alpha"
