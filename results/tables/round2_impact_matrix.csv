C6: Survivorship Bias,13a,Low-star restaurants show H CV=18.6% (vs 2.4% high-star). Tipping point: need 200+ ghost dishes with H↓≥2 for H>10%. With 334 ghosts (Delta=2): H contributes 12.8%.,Low-Medium: confirms selection effect exists but E dominance robust
C7: Unit-of-Comparison Problem,13b,"Within Full Mains: H=0.5% of Var, DEI range=25x (vs 345x global). Meal-level: H contributes 0.6%. 6,611 calorie-equivalent substitutions (mean E↓45%).",Medium: headline number drops from 345x to 25x but E still dominates
C8: Oversimplified Hedonic Definition,13c,"Satiety CV=33% (vs taste CV=4%). At w_satiety=0.3: H contributes 0.5%, rank rho=0.998. Even at w_satiety=1.0 (satiety only): H=11.3%, rho=0.946.","Low: even adding satiety dimension, E dominance holds"
C9: Refinement Curve Causal Weakness,13d,"91/165 (55%) within-family pairs significant. 68% have negligible effect size (d<0.2). Price tier slope=+0.10 (p<0.001): modest refinement signal exists. Cross-platform: Google alpha=0.35, TA alpha=-0.02, Yelp alpha=0.12.",Medium: BERT can discriminate but effect sizes tiny; refinement curve is 'suggestive evidence' not definitive
C10: Sample/Geographic Bias,13e,"14 states, Gini=0.46. City H consistency: mean rho=0.232 (low). But state-level DEI rho>0.993 (high). All cuisines span 14 states.",Medium: H varies by city (local preferences) but DEI rankings stable across states
