nQaNNS1L3sgdY74J7udtvg,quesadilla,"I strongly didn't believe what I was told because when I asked, the girl gave me a look like she knew that I wouldn't be accommodated but she still asked someone was there anymore chicken and the guy immediately said no but it was in a way that showed he just didn't want to cut any or grill any. Extremely disappointing as me and my friends had really wanted Felipe's. I had ordered 5 chicken quesadillas but had to cancel one of them because I refused to eat dry chicken. My friends still got their's as they were really hungry and didn't want to go some place else. I went to Five Guy's next door where I was guaranteed hot, fresh food.",3.25,1.0,,
NJKYdNrrMRpH68ZclAi5pA,korean_fried_chicken,"First and last visit here. I worked in KFC management when I was younger. What goes on in this restaurant, I'm not sure. Standards are hard to find.",5.5,1.0,,
pTamYS-9o2MenX96T2PiTQ,ribs,"Earlier today my friend suggested we go to Roy's for some brisket. I had been here before to get beer but had never had the food. So I wanted to try the best they had to offer so I got a half rack of ribs, and order of brisket, three sides, a drink and a pack of cigarettes... $27. I couldn't believe how little I was paying. So anyways we head home and go to town. The ribs fall off the bone, the brisket melts in your mouth, and I'm like a pig in shit. My friends were getting annoyed with how much I was talking about it. After cleaning my plate, I knew I had to try more.",1.0,5.0,,
B-tpnyH09Zqap20FThj9Kw,risotto,"The carbonara and salmon pasta were both dry and bland, adding salt and pepper somewhat made it good. The salmon in the pasta are like flakes that was mixed in the sauce and they were not a lot. The lobster risotto was okay. Again, nothing wow about it and I also think there was not enough lobster meat in it. All dishes were not finished and were taken home to be recooked for tomorrow. We do not mind waiting especially when the place is full but earlier was different. I do not think I will be back. Carbonara, lobster risotto, salmon pasta + tip cost $78.",3.25,3.0,,
hpo789E_rM1jEYThthpEpg,dan_dan_noodles,"He knows his stuff. But I digress. Onto the food:

an8OCv97ID5WBU4c-6aqcw,paneer_tikka,"The food was amazing and l loved the green sauce, but I totally whiffed on my order. I thought I ordered the Paneer Butter Masala entree, but mistakenly ordered the paneer tikka appetizer. It was still very good, but my heart was set on some Indian comfort food, cheese cooked in a hearty creamy tomato sauce. Instead I got grilled cottage cheese and veggies which is more of a appetizer.",3.25,4.0,,
yxHg5GkNKEE5Jx9XqQqf6w,pad_thai,"I got the Pad Thai, and it tasted like General Tso's sauce mixed in with noodles - not like any Pad Thai I've had before, so it was very disappointing. Beef was good, though. We came on a Saturday night with just our party of 5, and it took longer than usual to get our orders and our food.",3.25,3.0,,
Sxakys8vrnHuukTcIBlefw,gazpacho,"Well they were refreshing alright; basically water, with super sweet apple and strawberry flavoring not one piece of fresh fruit, a splash of Bacardi and NO mint. Did not taste good at all. For dinner I ordered the cold gazpacho soup, which was very tasty and fresh, so I was pleased with my first selection. On the other hand the tomato and mozzarella salad was very disappointing. The tomatoes were ok, but there was literally a handful of quarter sized pieces of mozzarella alongside the salad.",5.5,1.0,,
OAw5trVmhgLjsl31rbk-0A,fried_rice,"My oldest son and I decided to check this place out for an early dinner before he took off for small group at church. The hibachi was good (not great), don't get me wrong, nothing bad, I just don't understand why they don't put bacon in the fried rice out here. The highlight of the evening however, was the tornado roll: a spicy tuna roll roped with an amazing melted topping that included spicy crab, scallops, and some kind of cheese (cream cheese maybe)? Oh my goodness...I'll be back for that roll if nothing else!!!",5.5,4.0,,
IP49tKryMD2o7hdeyAgIng,samgyeopsal,"A couple of months ago, you needed a reservation almost every night of the week. I think it was about 30% full when we were there. I had a ""pork belly"" salad, and it had 2 chunks of pork belly on it....probably about the same weight as 2-3 strips of bacon, I guess. Were those two chunks yummy? Yes. Gee, thanks... I've never done this before...I heard the phrase ""that doesn't have bread under her breath"" more than once. She said ""pot roast doesn't have bread in it"" and I knew then that I wasn't going to be able to trust anything she said...so I just got that pork belly salad. And then it had a special garnish on top of fried onions that wasn't in the printed description. Fried in flour, of course.",3.25,3.0,,
2fTUlIg2IJ7iB5NpB09SuQ,tteokbokki,There was lack of Taste of wing sauce. We ended up leaving almost 1/3 of it. Spicy rice cake was good and garden salad was ok,5.5,4.0,,
bS4bKrDjFKbBY-3kB6f6BA,kimchi,"Then to the ramen, thank god they had corn which made it a tad bit better but the miso flavor was just lacking. I was really not impressed and didn't even finish my bowl... The second time I came back, we had the spicy kimchi ramen special on the back. Once again, not that tasty, maybe it's the broth. On top of that, the manager/waitress was yelling at one of the new employees in Chinese (which I understood) which made me feel terrible for him and enjoyed my meal less.",3.25,3.0,,
lq_nqev-meZ6Kkl6UBQ7XA,yakitori,Yakitori Boy has good happy hour prices and selection. It was nice to get small dishes and try a lot of different stuff. The taste was ok for me.,5.5,3.0,,
MNf2A-8uCOjdbJgK-pVhNg,bibimbap,"Overall I wasn't thrilled, I didn't know what to expect here other than Korean food, which I was excited about. I have to say the food was tasty. The only issue having split an appetizer, and ordering the bulgogi for myself and bibimbap for my wife was that I left hungry. My wife seemed happy with the portion size of the bibimbap. The portion size of bulgogi and serving of rice (which you have to order separately) May have been fine if it came with all the traditional accoutrements. Another peeve I have is with the style of business.",5.5,3.0,,
L1DkN2jA-zYrCEYEMxNhtQ,waffle,"I had Nina's 2 years ago and it was delicious. Unfortunately I had a sweet tooth last night and walked to Nina's. I ordered a waffle with 2 scoops of salted caramel ice cream with the pastry cream and whip cream, firstly he barley put any sauce on it that I paid for and totally skimped on the whip cream but what was really disturbing the flavor of the ice cream It had an old kick to it like it sat there through the winter or something. Normally I love salted caramel but last night all I was left with was a bitter taste. It cost me $10.",3.25,1.0,,
CDNtybdQjjad4y4GQPeTNw,xiao_long_bao,"If you're looking for dim sum in Philly, I would only recommend Dim Sum Garden. Make sure you get there before the crowd on the weekend lunch and dinner hours, or else you'll be waiting in a long line to get a table (which speaks volumes). Any trip to Dim Sum Garden is incomplete without the soup dumplings - make sure you try these, and eat them the right way if you want to actually enjoy it. Our group ordered a lot of food and we ended up really full. The best part was that the total only came out to $40 between 4 of us.",3.25,5.0,,
rhhalfT9syf7q6GGErppkw,hamburger,"Juicy Lucy's burger was yummy, but truth be told, for me to be totally wowed by a burger joint it's gotta go above and beyond. Above, yes, Juicy Lucy's is above average - but beyond. Well, no.",3.25,3.0,,
26vaqt-xZv3Uc7tjCz_R1g,congee,"We went at noon on a Sunday, they just opened at 11:30 so there was just another 2 tables there, so we got seated fast. One thing that hit me right away is what a huge menu they have with both Malaysian and Chinese cuisine, so if it's your first time here, you may be overwhelmed with all the choices. My parents ordered fish congee and chow mein, while I went for the pork chops and rice. When mine came, I was a bit disappointed, as I was expecting some kind of marinated pork chop. What I got was 2 breaded pork chops, white rice (which actually was lots), canned corn with couple pieces of broccoli, and a type of tartar sauce(?) on the side. It wasn't what I expected and was very plain, as well didn't start off well, as I found a piece of hair in the rice. My parents found the congee a bit watery, and still think the best congee is at Hong Kong Bakery. The chow mein was good though, nothing out of this world, but one of those things that is always a good standby. I noticed that the Malays",5.5,3.0,,

BDZBeFH4y0Ivx2fFyifRvA,pozole,I usually come here to pick up pozole or menudo for takeout. However there staff is really rude over the phone as they where when I picked up my order. I placed an order of menudo for picked up gave them my name and told me they where out.,3.25,1.0,,
SL37k3eGiZR6dqt8Qb57ew,lasagna,"Funny, they have been here several times and never complained and where I live is as safe as or safer than their restaurant location. Then the driver got lost even though she was given detailed instructions so the food was cold. Finally, I would NOT recommend the lasagna. It was filled with spinach with white cheese melted on top of it and was dry and burned. And absolutely no red sauce or cheese filling in site.",3.25,3.0,,
OZ5DsVQtYbdzZwhi4YN4hQ,satay,The bartender and I worked out something and made a custom made drink with lychee and gin and it was so delicious . I realized it was an Asian fix ion type of spot so they are mixing in both sides in their food . I had the pad Thai and a chicken satay which was so moist and delicious . The pad Thai was expensive $16 for a bowl that wasn't that big and the satay $6 . A bit overpriced ...,5.5,4.0,,
gCiDT6NQ_4SGwmeBlam2NQ,shawarma,"The order of the Delco pizza universe is restored. But what will set Marco's apart from the rest of the purveyors of pretty much the same pizza everywhere else? Marco's offers Brooklyn Square Pie, and chicken shawarma. That's a good start. I brought home a square pie with broccoli and pepperoni for the family and a chicken shawarma wrap for me tonight. And the verdict.... This is where I have a quandary.",5.5,3.0,,
0tCUahlBLDofMuxV_gR_iA,souffle,"The pig's foot was very good and I was pleased since this came highly recommended. The snapper was also very good, moist, tasty, but the vegetables which accompanied the fish did not seem to go very well. Then came dessert, a frozen Grand Marnier souffle and a pistachio creme something. We ended up not finishing the souffle, as we were both stuffed. Some espresso and some macaroons from the chef and we were all done. The staff was pleasant and polite and genuinely helpful.",5.5,3.0,,
h7U-fMnsTpfRyW3semBsFg,peking_duck,"The soup was a little too early for my taste, and there was a very small amount of meat and potatoes in the dish itself, with too many noodles. My parents frequently cook noodle soup back home, and I must say that I've had much better from my own kitchen. I wish that I could have sampled the peking duck, which Sang Kee is apparently known for. I got a small taste of the scallion pancakes and while the flavors were delicious, I was again put off by how oily the dish was. Good for a filling dinner as I was full for the rest of the night, but Sang Kee did not impress my palate.",5.5,3.0,,
Fyh6yBEWSzb-6gCjOWK9ww,tabbouleh,"New management has not been an improvement. The menu remains similar but the recipes are definitely lower quality- from the rice to the pita to the meat. The tabouli no longer has lemon juice, the meat came out lukewarm, the pita was hard and unpleasant. I no longer recommend this as a lunch spot.",3.25,1.0,,
UIXaL-8S9gmVQLYpi-kNPg,taco,"Came here expecting some good local Mexican food, left disappointed. The service could've been better, as our waitress gave us our food then disappeared for more than 30 minutes and had us have to go up and ask for the check. I asked for no cilantro on my taco, but it was covered in cilantro when I got it. Since this is a Mexican restaurant, I can't really knock them for that. The food was the most disappointing part. I got the enchilada and taco combo platter, which came with rice and beans. While the portion size was amazing, I could not say the same for my actual food. The beef inside my enchilada was burnt, and the entire thing was under a thick layer of greasy cheese. The fish inside my taco was so bland that if I hadn't known it was fish, it could've been anything. The rice and beans were fine but not enough to save my meal. While the meal and service were not that great, this restaurant has a great interior design and portions.",3.25,2.0,,
vyMHrW79w8U_JxPyb0CHcg,katsu,"If I'm happy, they make me overjoyed. I take houseguests here, which I think is high praise. I love the katsu sauce. I love the fries. I love the bar (the stools are short, so as a short girl, I don't feel like I'm on a highchair).",5.5,5.0,,
VRJKGi2-4h_nm_XolmOR9Q,creme_brulee,"It's just okay. The food is simply AMAZING! The creme brulee french toast is to die for... as are the omelettes and the rosemary potatoes. We were able to get a table outside, which was perfect.",5.5,4.0,,
0GLFj8HPGU1pZhX71K7TLQ,satay,"Beef Haw Fun, what's fun about chewy beef in a bowl of GREASY noodles. I don't recall asking for extra GREASY Basil fried rice. Satay chicken cooked over 1000° wood burning grill, thigh meat that was GREASY, mushy, and no char at all. I can't really say much for the service either. I had high hopes for this place but was extremely disappointed.",3.25,1.0,,
fokE7QwCZJb1C4xNx-Epww,creme_brulee,"It's not. The food tastes amazing. I had the onion tart, grilled filet, creme brulee, bread pudding, and a French 75. My friend got the lemonfish, all were fantastic. Our servers Phillip and Sarah were also wonderful.",3.25,5.0,,
Dzf6wLw3PfoDlWWdLtrgYQ,ribs,"Then, not long after this, we were informed that sliced pork was again available. Not sure how that happens in the span of 10 minutes. As if all this weren't enough, the server showed up again to inform us they were out of ribs. More order changes... When our orders did finally show up, we were short one.",3.25,3.0,,
vg_eiWSOiVtuar0z17gVuQ,pulled_pork,"It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I was expecting, but the drink was only $2 for the happy hour special so it was a good deal. Sloppy Hoggs is a bbq joint and known for their huge, crazy portions of meat. While I debated getting the pulled pork sandwich I settled for the mini red beans and rice with cornbread. Really they sold me at cornbread. The read beans and rice was really good, a little spicy, and even though I didn't see it listed on the menu it was served with some chicken that had a light smoked flavour.",5.5,4.0,,
SNFE4XC-USWT-Dc-BfID_w,guacamole,"Food was mediocre. Ordered a taco salad no Guacamole..It was LOADED!!!! I am allergic to avocados....What is this a communication error??? And what was up with beanie weenies, was that a dis to gringos?",1.0,1.0,,
FSWmdqIC3G4NBVRPBe6VmA,green_curry,"portion size is pretty good too. we ended up getting a box. -Curry: started with an ""M"" something curry, and is listed below the red and green curry. basically it's a Yellow curry. coconut milk, chicken, potatoes.",5.5,4.0,,
DM9ZlArU3XdFR1GT6WVqBw,mapo_tofu,All too sweet... I ordered Mapo tofu. But I got some sweet fried tofu with lots of broccoli. I asked it that really was Mapo and it really was.,3.25,2.0,,
gOr2xJQulbJ7-kcdU-TGTQ,taco,"Overall, not an amazing experience, but not bad. I wouldn't seek it out again, but if someone wanted to go I wouldn't be opposed. Might try something else on the menu--they also have tacos and tortas.",5.5,3.0,,
ikaqCdVvDKDBWgoFPzyFsg,tempura,"We sat for nearly 10 minutes before we met our server. They have a nice variety on the menu. The tempura veggies/seafood are very good. The gyoza and crab puffs (Rangoon) are not very good. Tom Yum soup lacks that familiar tang. None of the rolls were exciting with flavor. Just all very ""meh.""  No issues with freshness as the fish seemed fine. The Thai Curry was a hit, with the veggies in it being tempura fried. Very unique and delicious. Entrees for 5 people came out at different times, one was just raw fish and it took the longest. Tempura cheesecake was wildly delicious. The worst part was that we were seated near the end of the hallway that lead to the restrooms (I assume.). We lived with a putrid smell all night.",5.5,3.0,,
uyJxgMBM09ipkvQ_uKnQLQ,enchilada,"For the price I paid I wouldn't order that again. I ordered the lentil walnut pate with a baguette for us to start, and a lemongrass minty vermicelli bowl for a main. My one friend ordered the pulled jackfruit enchilada, while the other ordered the laska soup. For sure my favourite was the lentil walnut pate...rich and nutty it tasted comforting on the cold spring day. My lemongrass minty vermicelli bowl was good, but again was advertised as spicy and I felt that it was a bit underwhelming.",5.5,3.0,,
-LQUa1w86C022xD37YysSg,french_fries,The TV in the booth and charging station is a nice touch. The Cajun chicken pasta dish was good and the funnel fries with chocolate and strawberry sauce was a great little dessert. Service was really good as well.,7.75,5.0,,
vqDWLDNjf4z1WALydc7lgg,brownie,"This is like the Long's of the southside (yes I know there is a Long's on Southport but I'm an Indy native so don't judge). They carry delicious donuts that are pretty damn good. I love the selection of donuts they have, but they have a very nice variety of cakes, cookies, brownies, and coffee cakes. The coffee cakes came in a few varieties which would be good if you're hosting a brunch or some type of shower. I think the prices are very comfy with what they offer.",7.75,4.0,,
t1AxLM6bqU5Fsqimq82lxQ,tom_kha,"Asian Infusion type restaurant. I like their spicy California rolls and their happy hour prices. I get the Tom Kha Gai soup for $4 and add rice to make it a meal. As usual a lot of these restaurants don't use chicken thighs or dark meat, but rather thin slices of chicken breasts for their chicken. It seems like in Idaho..",7.75,3.0,,
vCfUZcqtCi8rnfUJhpsG-w,waffle,"The ice cream flavors are unique and delicious. The quality is premium and smooth. The shop smells heavenly, especially since they're constantly making waffle cones while you order. The booze ice cream flavors are a definite must try mixed with the nonalcoholic flavors. They do ask for I.D.",7.75,4.0,,
g4tKKKZceLQ4enIOMrTJ1w,butter_chicken,"While small, the food is OH SO GOOD! Their naan is fresh made, so allow a little time for it to come out. I really liked their Butter chicken, it was rich and flavourful. My guys both had the chicken Tikka masala, hot. They had tears in their eyes and very happy bellies.",7.75,4.0,,
FaMNwSbY9gN0DaTu3xvbpw,larb,Delivery was pretty quick and the delivery person was very friendly. I will order again without a doubt. I ordered curry and larb gai. The larb in appearance was not what im used to but it was spot on in flavor. Its sad to see two recent less than stellar reviews one from someone who states that they dont care for unamerican food...but complains about the spice. FYI thai is notoriously spicy.,7.75,5.0,,
8lyhy_XiO6xupbDvYOO4tg,tom_kha,"It was really good. A bit sweet maybe, but everything was excellent. We loved the Tom Kar soup (what they call Tom Kha Kai) and coconut rice so much, we bought extra to take home!",7.75,5.0,,
LP2yn0vdT8G-_7njdvakkQ,pasta_bolognese,"We shared an artisan cheese and salad for an appetizer. The cheese paired perfectly with the yummy bottle of wine we brought (I love BYOBs!!!). For dinner I had the Striped Bass and my husband had the Short Rib Ragu. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. My husband liked the Ragu, but tired of it quickly. It was delicious but super hearty and filling. There's only so much short rib you can eat.",7.75,4.0,,
O6M_bH4Rj2kLVZjkqREuug,okonomiyaki,"Had an enjoyable lunch at Otaku but the ramen was not quite up to New York standards. Nevertheless a welcome change from Nashville hot chicken and fries. Started off with gyoza (slightly bland with a super sour sauce) and okonomiyaki, their Sunday special. Between 4 people we still left about a quarter uneaten. Smelled a little fishy but tasted pretty good.",7.75,3.0,,
iEHvIsirKpy-eER9petCtQ,orange_chicken,"All their food is a bit oily & has a lot of garlic, but damn it's so good! - Oil Splashing Noodles are my few favorite! - Their Orange Chicken has a spicy kick to it! - When you order wontons to go the container is overflowing with wonton dumplings!!! The plain broth is the way to go, when I ordered the oily ones they were too oily, but tasted great when I added them to 2 cups of chicken broth at home, worked well to to dilute the oil and keep the chili flavor.",7.75,5.0,,
uVLn6fO_7APLPwXnZuHwgg,congee,"the restaurant is very nicely decorated. asian-y, but without being over the top ridiculous brothel-y, and definitely not gaudy like the fancy chinese restaurants in chinatown. we had the duck ceviche, marinated cabbage, congee, spareribs, salt crusted branzino, and hot pot. spareribs are quite tasty. the branzino was melt-in-your-mouth perfect (for $55, it had better be!).",7.75,3.0,,
0tU5iw_4fA9Hq3lOb0Lk9A,ca_phe_sua_da,"Relaxing and quiet music. My coffees were always good. I loved the Vietnamese iced coffee. I've never had it before and had to look up online what to do with it, once the barista brought it to the table (I didn't know about the condensed milk sitting on the bottom). Otherwise, always great service.",7.75,5.0,,
N_HIfhsnZ2PbyuPIeru6-Q,chicken_sandwich,"You're probably wondering why I am giving them 4 stars if I have all these wonderful things to say. I have been a couple of times, service is definitely dependent on the time you go and the server you get. I have yet to have an entree I was wowed by; I've tried the tandoori salmon, the Honey butter chicken sandwich, and the pesto BLT. And last, but certainly not least, there is no such thing as getting bang for your buck at Louie's. My bill is always far more than I expected to pay for what I've ordered.",7.75,4.0,,
0sbWNffIzpwXmVur67qMkQ,baba_ganoush,"To really enjoy this place you have to expect that there will be a wait for your table sometimes 10 minutes or sometimes over an hour all dependent on what time of day and what day of the week you choose to go because they don't reservations. But if you go with this in mind and are willing to wait either on the benches outside or across the street at New Wave then you're ahead of the game. Whenever I eat here I always order the mussels sauteed (I think they're actually lightly floured and then pan fried), the grilled octopus, the shrimp scampi and the baba ganoush from the small plates section and then typically we'll order a platter to share. You can rarely go wrong if you choose one of the specials for the night. I also love the endless grilled pita they give you dipped in the oil that's left over from the shrimp scampi.",7.75,4.0,,
P_MvhLamhypThf53pypkmw,pasta_carbonara,"The four of us had a table right next to the fire place- perfect ambiance for a post holiday dinner. We all loved our food. I had the capellini carbonara with pancetta cream sauce and it was perfectly cooked and had awesome flavor. My only gripe is that everything is a la carte. To me, a chicken parm entree just isn't complete without a side of pasta!",7.75,5.0,,
54K4omqU9sxkp0no-5lFWg,waffle,California wrap was loaded with avocado and turkey. And Black Jack chicken sandwich was delicious. Waffle fries are also good and generously portioned. It's a fun place to go watch sports on tv or before a Pelicans game. Good for families.,7.75,4.0,,
sA5bgLugtVnZE9sPXB_9Qg,churro,"These are the staples I always order. The ambiance is fun with music in the bar area or a little quieter in the back area. Sunday brunch is a great time to sit outdoors in the nice weather and enjoy the delicious quiche, seafood crepes and apple churros. The service tends to be pretty slow and they commonly make mistakes, but the upside is you end up with some items you may not have ordered so you can try more. They always fix their mistakes and ensure your experience is great.",7.75,4.0,,
AiUNKpa67K118mUbqUwfeA,baklava,Very filling. We ended our meal with dessert. Baklava...amazing cinnamon flavor and not honey drenched like the baklava I've had so many times before. We also shared the Knafeh--a heavenly blend of baklava and cheescake. Very rich and very good. The ONLY problem I had with Ranoush was our server.,7.75,4.0,,
fv2bG7FlF7yU3THvQwkQ6A,bibimbap,"So I come here for the Korean food and it's my favorite in town, not that there are many other options in town. The menu is limited, but I've been happy with what I get. Bibimbap comes in a generous silver bowl with lots of goodies and they will substitute tofu in place of meat if you're vegetarian. The ddubbokki is an enormous portion, can feed 2 people. It's served in a big bowl with rice cakes, fish cakes and mussels, with a hotplate flaming underneath.",7.75,4.0,,
jdG8CfcPF6eQXLBAvuNMaw,papaya_salad,"Had too much sugar on the top but it was absolutely great to have to top the meal off with. It comes in a cup with possible condensed milk over it so it doesn't come dry like the other restaurants. ***We also ordered the Papaya Salad with sticky rice but it didn't come out but the waiter (who is not related to the owners) still tried to charge us for it. So check your bill before paying!!!***

We spent a total of 2 hours at this restaurant. Most of it was waiting.",7.75,3.0,,
AC4swx8K8uT5g85lOxXKIg,pizza,"Despite Domino's being a widespread pizza chain, this one in particular deserves 5 stars. I've never had such good customer service in a consistent manner as I have from this store. I've seen it go through 3 store managers and the most recent 2 have been awesome. The only reason I would consider giving them a 4 out of 5 (but I'm not) is because their delivery service is somewhat poor, in my opinion. Drives have been, on occasion, abrasive, or they've gotten lost or something like that. All in all, though, this store creates excellent quality pizza combined with good customer service and I would definitely recommend them.",7.75,5.0,,
y2zMU5QmiapomDyx9paTVA,sashimi,"I have a feeling this is Cherry Hill's treasured sushi restaurant; nearly all the tables were reserved for the Friday night 7pm dinner crowd. We just happened to pop in very early evening. Try the Nigiri platter for a good variety of rolls and sashimi. On the hot side, the steamed gyoza were piping hot and delicate, and the poke appetizer had a nice kick.",7.75,4.0,,
31K_849n4gL7S15Yv67Fmg,ca_phe_sua_da,"The hot lattes rival the other gourmet coffee places in the area (Barista Parlor!), but with better prices. Large latte for $4! They also have Vietnamese coffee on the regular menu, which is a great and unique addition that nowhere else has (besides Vietnamese restaurants). Sadly, it's got an odd flavor. I've ordered it several times and it hasn't hit the spot. I'm a huge Vietnamese coffee fan and really love that they include it on the menu, so I'll still give them props for that! I got the yogurt parfait once and it was really nice. A pretty big bowl full of goodness and granola.",7.75,5.0,,
XSmapJW_XNRcuY3wPiOAfQ,sushi,"Hubby, kids and myself went in on a Tuesday night for dinner. We sat by the sushi bar since we didn't want to do habachi. Kids ordered rice with chicken, took a little long. Hubby and I ordered sushi rolls. I ordered the Hawaiian roll and it was delicious! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the service.

-Salted Caramel Latte: YUM

We went this weekend for brunch, everyone has fried chicken and waffles, which was wonderful. However, I wanted to update this review because I noticed that UC has dropped their prices by $2-$4/entree across the board. The price point seems far more in line with what they're serving now. We will definitely continue coming back. Fantastic use of an old gas station. We sat indoors and both ordered the fried chicken and cucumber Salad.

Coq au vin
Chicken rochumbeau 
No dessert and 2 cocktails  well 3 but one was so bad we didnt drink it and the lime was old. They immediately apologized and replaced the drink. Which we paid for.but personal taste hated it anyway.

The waitress was too busy talking to her coworkers up front to see us waving and trying to get her attention multiple times. Then at the end we asked for boxes for 3 separate dishes plus the congee which is a soup like. And she said ""use one box don't waste"" I was like "" no were going to need 2 more boxes.""

If they had vegetable samosas or gulab jamun as I've eaten at other buffets, I would be coming here a lot more often though!

While the ice cream they serve is certainly no hand made gelato, and that they could not compensate me for not being able to complete my order twice, I gawked at the price out loud making sure everyone in line could hear.
